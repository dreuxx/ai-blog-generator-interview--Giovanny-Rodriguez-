# Backend Interview: AI-Powered Blog Post Generator with Daily Automation

**Objective**

Create a simplified Python/Flask application that, given a keyword, performs a bit of “SEO research” and then calls OpenAI to generate a draft blog post (with basic structure and placeholder affiliate links). 
Additionally, set up a daily cron job (or scheduler) so the app automatically generates a new post for a predefined keyword once per day.

## Project Setup & Deliverables

1. **Repository**
    - Create a GitHub repo named `ai-blog-generator-interview-<YourName>`.
    - Include all source code, a `requirements.txt`, and a `README.md` with setup/run instructions.
2. **Technologies & Libraries**
    - **Python**
    - **Flask** (REST API)
    - **OpenAI**
    - Anything else you would like
    - **(Optional) A small “SEO data” library** or a JSON file to mock keyword metrics
3. **Environment & API Keys**
    - You’ll need an OpenAI API key. Store it in a `.env` file
    - If you choose real SEO data (via a free API), store those keys similarly. Otherwise, mock the SEO metrics
4. **Core Deliverables**
    - A Flask app (`app.py`) exposing at least one endpoint:
        
        ```
        GET /generate?keyword=<your_keyword>
        
        ```
        
    - A module (`seo_fetcher.py`) that returns `search_volume`, `keyword_difficulty`, and `avg_cpc` for any given `keyword` (mock or real).
    - A module (`ai_generator.py`) that calls OpenAI with a structured prompt to generate a blog post draft (HTML or Markdown), replacing `{{AFF_LINK_n}}` placeholders with dummy URLs.
    - A scheduler setup—either:
        1. An **APScheduler** job within `app.py` that runs once a day and triggers generation for a predefined keyword (e.g., `"wireless earbuds"`), storing the result in a local file or printing to console;
        2. **OR** a **shell script** (e.g., `generate_daily.sh`) plus instructions to add a **crontab** entry that hits `http://localhost:5000/generate?keyword=<your_keyword>` daily and saves the JSON to disk.
    - A `README.md` detailing how to install, run, and configure the scheduler or cron job.

## Deliverables

**1.) Video Demo (≤5 minutes)** showing:

- How you installed and ran the app locally
- Hitting the `/generate?keyword=<…>` endpoint and viewing the JSON result
- How the daily scheduler (APScheduler or cron) works—e.g., showing one saved file
- Anything else you’d like to discuss

**2.) Example Generated Blog Post**

- Include a separate file (e.g., `example_wireless_earbuds.html` or `example_wireless_earbuds.md`) containing one full blog post generated by your app (for any keyword you choose). This helps us see exactly how your output is structured. **Send the example blog post in the email message below as well.**
